# The Conquerors of Mystery

Due to actions by Github, please see our home on Codeberg: https://codeberg.org/Conquerors_Of_Mystery

Christian Public domain software initiative.

"So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;" - Prov 2:2

## What do we stand for?

Public domain, freely available, Christ-respecting software. We write code
using the undeserved blessings of God.

## What does this organization host?

Code written or maintained by Christians which resides in the public domain for the enjoyment of the public.

## Can I join?

Yes. Post an issue on [this](https://github.com/ConquerorsOfMystery/.github) repository with a confession of faith
and why you want to join.

## Are there any rules/requirements for members who join?

BEHAVE. That's pretty much the only rule.

Requirements? You must be a Christian. Not a catholic. Your code must be public domain in order to be submitted
to this repository. Note that MIT, GPL, BSD licensed code are NOT public domain.

## Any restrictions on what code we can use?

All code must be able to be usable without any attribution. If someone downloads your code they should be free to use it without carrying around
any LICENSE files or attribution notices.

If you can link to copyrighted code while maintaining this, then it's fine (E.g. SDL2) but if you must provide attribution then it is not allowed.
